Do whatever you want with it. License your code under this software, use it commercially, etc.

Only one request from us: If you modify the license, **PLEASE** change the name of the license. It will be extremely confusing if there are 20 different versions of the OML, all called "OML" and all with different clauses. Either call it "Modified ..." (ie "Modified Open Model License") and say it is not an official Open Model License OR change the name completely. **ALSO:** Please do NOT just change the version number. For example, if the current OML is v1, and you modify it and call it "OMLv2," if in the future Open Model License creates OMLv2 there will be issues with this. Thanks!

This is a switch from the CC0 license to prevent confusion. **THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL DEDICATED INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN UNDER THE CC0 LICENSE, HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE NAME CLAUSE IS OPTIONAL, WE STRONGLY REQUEST THAT YOU ADHERE BY IT TO PREVENT CONFUSION.** Thank you!
