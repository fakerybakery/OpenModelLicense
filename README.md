# Open Model License

A permissive license for distributing AI models. **Disclaimer: IANAL**

## The Problem

Existing licenses refer to "software" or "source code." Does an AI model count as "source code?"

## The Solution

Just modify the MIT license to clarify this!

## The Licenses

We propse four licenses, a basic, permissive
